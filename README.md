How to execute the program:

The project was created with the latest python version (3.12). To install the latest libraries available, open a terminal window of choice and run the following commands:
#### Firstly run: 
    pip install --upgrade pip
1) pip install pygame
2) pip install torch
3) pip install numpy
4) pip install tkinter
5) pip install dataclasses

or just 

    pip install -r requirements.txt


### After all needed libraries are successfully installed

Unzip "Connect4Agent.zip" file, inside there will be python Notebook called "training_code.ipynb" which contains the code for the training of our agent. This procedure is thoroughly explained inside the notebook.

#### Also there is a "main.py" that when all needed dependencies are installed and run via an IDE or like so: 

    python main.py

This will boot up the Graphical User Interface where the user can interact with the trained agent, the random bot and play against another human.
